# To-Do List

I build a To-Do list that allows user to create,edit, and delete tasks.
In the application user can add new tasks, mark as completed tasks, and delete a tasks.
To build an application I use HTML to create the interface, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to handle user interactions such as adding and removing tasks, displaying a count of remaining tasks and saving the task to local storage.
